<h1 id="gatherings">Gatherings</h1>
<h2 id="los-angeles-in-ruins">Los Angeles in Ruins</h2>
<p>Los Angeles: once a vibrant, spawling urban metropolis, now unrecognizable. The extreme heat waves and prolonged droughts cracked and broke the already dry land and its people. News of the great city's demise spread as a cautionary tale told by people gethered around lonely campfires braving the long nights in the wasted world. Before the Shattering, the thirsty city of Los Angeles piped hundreds of millions of gallons of water per day through hundreds of miles of concrete aqueducts from the San Joaquin-Sacramento River delta, the Colorado River, and runoff from the snow melts in the Eastern Sierra mountain range. After the government collapsed, this rat's nest of concrete channels and pipes and basins were taken over by the Family. They weren't really a family, of course. In less desperate times, we would've laughted at their pastiche of the golden age of gangster films complete with pin-striped suits and unrefusable offers. Nobody was laughing as they quickly eliminate their rivals and captured total control of the water supply. If you wanted water, you needed to go through the Family.   </p>
<p>As the drought deepened, the rich were able to pay the predatory fees to keep their lawns green and swimming pools full. Hundreds of thousands fled the city along the chaotic highways. Thirst took many of those who were stuck in the rush to move further north and further inland. As months and years passed, the drought deepened still and many miles of aqueduct lay dry and baking in the scorching sun. Fewer wealthy were able to pay the fees for water and they moved away. Some of the people who remained in the city had banded together and cut secret siphon points into the water system and were able to survive with stolen water. It was dangerous to operate these siphon points, and many who visited them never returned, but the people who remained in Los Angeles and couldn't afford the Family's water fees were desperate. </p>
<p>A few years after the Shatter, after the Family had taken control of the water supplies, they held a conference for academics and artists. While their style, in better times, would've been laughable, the Family valued the arts, and they knew that the only way to survive was to win over the researchers and intellectuals who could figure out how to rebuild the world. In those days, it was dangerous to travel to and attend large gatherings, but the Family send out caravans of appropriated buses and used dwindling fuel supplies to go from district to district to gather up these people and bring them to the conference. Not only did the Family provide transportation and security, but they also offered several hundred double dollars ($$) of water vouchers to attendees. Anakin and Alya both independently chose to attend. </p>
<p>As they arrived at the event, Anakin saw that the Los Angeles Convention Center remained largely intact. They walked through the large entryway and immediately saw their old friend Sybil Suntaker, Ph.D. (You had to say it "Sybil Suntaker, Ph.D." and not "Sybil" or "Suntaker" or even "Dr. Suntaker" and on no circumstance Dr. Sybil or Dr. S.) Sybil Suntaker, Ph.D. walked up to Anakin and said, "Oh, Ani, there's someone you absolutely must meet." Sybil Suntaker, Ph.D. walked Anakin across the room to where Alya stood by an opulate table of bottled water with their support dog, Apollo that lay patiently and happily on the cool, concrete floor. </p>
<p>"Alya...Alya, I need to introduce you to my friend Anakin. They've been keeping the Ronald Reagan Medical Center at UCLA operating as much as possible with their limited supplies, but they've been struggling to keep up the community lines that get people into the hospital. I think you both could be of some help to each other."</p>
<p>Alya and Anakin have a conversation and they go their separate ways after the conference, but Anakin promises to send an ambulance with an escort to pick up Alya the following week.</p>
<p>The day of their planned meeting arrives, and Alya comes to the hospital to find the driver ill. They'd been careless with their PPE and had come down with the most recent disease that was sweeping the ruins of the city. Ever resourceful, Alya begin asking if anyone would be willing to drive out and pick up Anakin. It happened that Joe Rogan, who had turned to help others when their media empire collapsed, had just arrived. They'd been shuttling the sick an injured to medical centers, and they heard Alya asking for help. They stepped up and offered to drive.</p>
<p>As Joe drove down the ruined highway across town to find Anakin, they saw a lone traveller walking down the side of the road with a cat riding on their shoulder. This gave them pause because nobody walked alone in LA anymore. It wasn't safe. This must've been a fortunate outsider who'd made it into the city without getting jumped. Joe stopped the car and invited the stranger to get in with their cat. They do, and they continue on to uneventfully collect Anakin and return them all safely to the medical center. </p>
<h2 id="the-big-one">The Big One</h2>
<p>The old saying, "when it rains, it pours" was definitely true for Seattle, Washington. Scientists who study earthquakes had been predicting the big one for decades, placing the probability of it hitting sometime between 2000 and 2100 at around 95%. They predicted massive destruction. It hit the day the final government services stopped operating. SOHCAH had been sitting in their third floor apartment when they felt a massive shaking. Pictures fell from the walls and buildings swayed about wildly like sun flowers or corn stalks in a tornado. SOHCAH dove under their dining room table, which they'd gotten from a thrift store for $30, but whihc was made of solid wood. It took most of the force as plaster exploded from the walls and ceiling as the back half of the building crumbled into the street below. When the shaking stopped, SOHCAH crawled out from under the table and looked out from where the back wall of the apartment had been. They were uninjured, and they carefully picked their way down a slope of rubble and into the street. </p>
<p>In the aftermath of the quake, groups that had volunteered in search and rescue in the Cascades before the Shattering banded together and searched for survivors. SOHCAH set up in a less destroyed hospital wing at the University of Washington Medical Center and provided the medical care they could. It was there that SOHCAH met Azra. Azra had been provided medical care to her community after the Shattering. They'd been a veterinarian before, and they found that treating humans was not so unlike treating cats and dogs and horses. They'd raided a medical storage site, but that had set the local gangs who had been hoarding supplies after them. Azra fled with their cat and found themselves in Seattle shortly after the quake. Azra had been inspired by the work they'd seen SOHCAH doing, and they met one day as Azra volunteered to help. They became quick friends and SOHCAH taught Azra a great deal. </p>
<p>Seattle got worse. The earthquake had partially destroyed most of the bridges and some neighborhoods had been completely abandoned. Access to resources wasn't the worst problem, but disease ran rampant in the damp streets and alleys. A new illness was emerging that people called the Frostbane Affliction or just the Affliction. People showed up in the hospital and SOHCAH and Azra saw a massive uptick in the terrifying disease. They realized that the city was lost and they needed to leave. As Azra thought on this and told SOHCAH that they'd heard of a safer commune in what had been the state of Arizona. it was hidden in the base of a canyon that branched off of what had once been Lake Powell until a group of ecological saboteurs had finished what a precision earthquake had started, removing Glen Canyon Dam. Azra's contact, Aria, had joined the commune early on and had been begging Azra to leave Seattle and join them for some time. The only problem was that Azra and SOHCAH didn't know how to navigate their way through the more than 1000 miles of wilderness between. </p>
<p>Before meeting Azra and SOHCAH, You're Gonnaneedme, who often went by Yuri after the first person to travel to space, had already weathered the harsh realities of the post-apocalyptic wasteland. As society crumbled, they'd leanred to adapt to the evolving dangers and challenges and honed their survival skills in they'd travelled from Seattle where they were born through broken ghost towns in the Cascade mountain range. They'd carefully navigated through territories of the newly formed neo-fascist Liberty State that stretched from Moses Lake east to the Great Plains and south to the border with the LDS Nation. Yuri had travelled back to Seattle as a courrier carrying whatever messages needed to cross long distances. They'd come into an unfortunate but unavoidable encounter with the Bellevue Boyz towards the end of their journey. The encounter saw Yuri left for dead on the eastern shore of Lake Washington, but somehow a random traveller had brought them to the hospital where SOHCAH and Azra worked. </p>
<p>As the Affliction escalated, Azra and SOHCAH found Yuri still resting in Seattle after recovering from their care in the hospital. Yuri agreed to guide them all to the commune, where they picked up Aria, who'd grown tired of the commune's lies and brainwashing. Together the companions turned back out into the waste. </p>
<h2 id="about-bobs-technology">About Bob's Technology</h2>
<p>It was a seemingly ordinary day at Bob's Technology Store, where customers browsed through the aisles, oblivious to the impending catastrophe. Even before the Shattering, Bob's Technology Store was a relic of a bygone era. Independent radio operators, computer enthusiasts, and other technophiles had flocked to Bob's in the 1980's to check out the newest models. Bob's had been founded by Bob's grandfather, Robert, who thought the future of computing would be in small mom-and-pop shops like his. As big box stores and boutique company storefronts gained monopoly over the market, many of Bob's competitors collapsed, but for some reason Bob's survived through three generations and now was in the hands of Bob. The current iteration of the store sold sensors, controllers, and microprocessors for robotics and experimental systems along with various other accessories. </p>
<p>Guy, a man with a keen interest in advanced medical supplies, roamed the shelves, examining the latest technological innovations for healthcare. Kevin, on the other hand, sought robotic parts, driven by the ambition to create an AI dog. Cassie, a young woman in her twenties, entered the store, searching for a replacement for her broken Apple headphones. Meanwhile, Dennis was on a mission to find the perfect new computer.</p>
<p>Little did they know that this day would be etched in history as the day of The Shattering. As the group of five—Kevin, Guy, Dennis, Cassie, and the store owner Bob—gathered within the walls of Bob's Technology Store, chaos erupted outside. Lights flickered, panic set in, and the world as they knew it crumbled.</p>
<p>Bob, sensing the impending danger, quickly ushered his customers to a secret man cave below the store. As he secured the entrance, the group huddled together in the darkness, their faces reflecting the uncertainty that gripped the world outside.</p>
<p>Through the night, the initial shockwaves of The Shattering subsided, and the group found themselves in the relative safety of the underground refuge. Bob, the store owner, initiated a conversation to break the tension, and one by one, each member shared their skills, strengths, and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Guy, with his technological expertise in medical supplies, spoke of his ability to navigate the intricate world of advanced healthcare technology. Kevin, the aspiring AI enthusiast, explained his proficiency in robotics and automation. Dennis, in search of a new computer, showcased his knowledge in computing and technology.</p>
<p>Cassie, with her broken headphones and a desire for communication, revealed her expertise in leadership and communication skills. Lastly, Bob, the store owner and now de facto leader in their shelter, shared his understanding of the store's inventory and the resources they could leverage.</p>
<p>Despite the dramatic and chaotic circumstances that brought them together, the diverse set of skills within the group seemed to complement each other. They realized that their unique talents could contribute to their survival in the altered world that awaited them beyond the safety of the man cave.</p>
<p>This chance meeting, born out of necessity and shared adversity, laid the foundation for a group of strangers to become close friends. As they faced the challenges of The Shattering together, the bonds forged in that underground refuge would become the bedrock of their resilience and cooperation in the days to come.</p>
<h2 id="the-cold-end-of-the-continent">The Cold End of the Continent</h2>
<p>Since its colonization, Alaska had always been seen as remote. It was the place you went if you wanted to get away from everyone and just be left alone. </p>
<p>Baker found himself exciled to the icy wilderness of Alaska after legal troubles following a football championship match-fixing scandal. They fled the authorities to Alaska, but as the Shattering broke the institutions that sought them, Baker now free navigated the frigid landscape seeking new alliances to reignite their criminal enterprises. There they crossed paths with Silver. Silver had been a medical student and since the Shattering had roamed the lands providing medical aid to the sick and injured. In their work to do good, they'd crossed paths with a faction, and as Silver found themself nearly revealed to the faction leader, they fled to Alaska where they encountered Baker. While Silver's original pursuit of medicine was empathetic and regulated, the Shattering had caused those values to soften, and now Silver was more pragmatic about things.</p>
<p>Silver and Baker encountered Bhumi as they travelled south through the Alexander Archipelago. The Shattering had left massive oil tankers adrift, and Bhumi had made it their mission to navigate the various islands of the Archipelago and do what they could to safely board and land the tankers until something could be done to remove the crude oil safely. Bhumi who'd been camping on tankers and islands for years saw an opportunity to do greater good by aligning themselves with Silver and Baker, and so they joined them on their travels. </p>
<p>David was always cautious, even bordering on "prepper." They'd established an underground refuge in a small fishing community on the Frederick Sound. Some scoffed at the refuge prior to the Shattering, saying it was a useless expense. It provded invaluable afterwards. David met Baker and Silver while seeking medical aid for their friend Kevin. Kevin had been in a serious fishing accident involving an improperly stored bin. The bin had fallen nearly crushing Kevin's leg. While the fishing community was largely self sufficient, it lacked medical professionals who could fix such a serious injury, so David volunteered to go for help. David met Baker, Bhumi, and Silver and persuaded them to return to the underground refuge in exchange for allowing them to stay there.</p>
<p>Valente, a poetic vagrant, roamed New England in search of poetic enlightenment. Disappointed by identical forests and abandoned towns, he headed north, hoping the arctic air would inspire him. Arriving in a quaint fishing village in southern Alaska, Valente found solace in the serene surroundings. His contemplation was interrupted by David and Bhumi, who arrived at the dock to catch fish.</p>
<h2 id="library-time">Library Time</h2>
<p>Amidst the desolation, a diverse group found solace and purpose in the rural areas of Victoria, BC, their lives converging within the walls of a small local library that became both a hideout and home base. Alex, seeking refuge in the library one night, stumbled upon the haven while scavenging the rural area. The small local library, seemingly untouched, proved to be a treasure trove of knowledge—a sanctuary where survival depended on adaptability and resourcefulness. In the quiet hours of the night, Alex took comfort in one of the few intact buildings, setting the stage for a new chapter.</p>
<p>In the morning light, Alex explored the library and, in the breakroom, found company in Cleo. The two formed a duo, their connection forged through shared circumstances and the desire for companionship in a world forever altered by The Shattering. As fate would have it, Hanna and Detroit crossed paths on their way to the library. Initially hesitant to team up, Hanna's reservations dissolved after a meaningful conversation with Detroit. Their shared understanding of the challenges they faced in this new world paved the way for an alliance.</p>
<p>Wandering through the aisles of books, the trio of Hanna, Detroit, and Alex serendipitously encountered each other. Hanna's gnarly cut became the catalyst for Alex's medical expertise to be put to the test. Alex quickly became a valuable addition to the group, showcasing her skills and fostering a sense of unity.</p>
<p>In the library's breakroom, Alex brought Hanna and Detroit, introducing Cleo to the group. They shared a temporary water supply, a precious 5-gallon dispenser—a symbol of survival in a world where resources were scarce. The library became their sanctuary, a place where individuals with diverse skills and backgrounds found common ground.</p>
<p>Lucas, a leader from a nearby settlement, sought an instruction manual for a crucial piece of technology. His quest led him to the library, now inhabited by the diverse group. After initial uncertainties, the library crew and the local community engaged in a dialogue. The realization dawned that odds of survival were better when they stood together. The library, once a shelter in the night, evolved into a communal hub—a testament to the strength found in unity amidst the ruins of the old world.</p>
<p>In the heart of Victoria, BC, a small local library became more than just a refuge; it became the epicenter of a collective journey, where individual stories intertwined to create a narrative of survival, community, and the relentless pursuit of hope in the aftermath of The Shattering.</p>
