# Earth 2043

Earth...2043. A decade ago the world faced a catestrophic global crisis that led to the collapse of societies as we know them. This crisis, known now only as "The Shattering," saw runaway global warming, economic collapse, and widespread conflict that reshaped the world order. The old ways fell, and the remnants of civilazation are scattered across a desolate landscape. 

## A Recent History

There had been hints of the vulnerability of the global water supplies through the first decades of the 21st century. These initial droughts were severe, but nations with the resources were able to bring water to areas experiencing drought. People living in places without such resources had to migrate elsewhere. The world witnessed alarming changes in climate patterns. Glaciers melted rapidly, sea levels rose, and extreme weather events became more frequent. In the 2030's, after a brief reprieve in the second half of the 20's, global warming intensified leading to widespread droughts. Freshwater sources dried up,turning once fertile lands into arid wastelands. Rivers and lakes became mere remnants of their former selves. Crops failed, and without reprieve from the droughts, strategic reserves were quickly depleted. 

As nations grappled with dwindling resources, competition for the remaining water, arable land, and energy sources intensified. As politicians failed to take decisive actions, corporations eventually took control, and competition for resources became the only guiding force for society. Competition quickly became armed conflict as corporations took control of armed forces, and the Resource Wars began. 

The resource wars strained economies, leading to a worldwide economic collapse. Governments crumbled under the weight of social unrest, and the concept of a global society disintegrated. In the absence of governments and centralized authorities, factions and loosely organized bands emerged to fill the power vacuum. THese factions had diverse ideologies and strategies for survival, each adapting to the harsh realities of the post-apocalpytic world in their own way. 

Now, the scars of the crisis are everywhere from scorched landscapes to the ruins of once-thriving cities. The world is now a dangerous and unforgiving place, where survival depends on adaptability, resourcefulness, and sometimes, the ability to navigate the politics of the factions that arose from the chaos.

## Classes

### Tech Engineer

Masters of scavenging and repurposing technology. They can repair broken devices, create makeshift gadgets, and understand the workings of pre-apocalyptic technology. The tech engineer not only needs to be able to solve problems with limited supplies, but they need to be able to teach non-experts how to use their technologies.

### Wilderness Scout

Experts in survival and exploration. They are adept at navigating the dangerous landscapes, tracking creatures, and finding valuable resources. The wilderness scout is crucial for gathering resources necessary for survival in a wasted world. When working with a team of tech engineers and argriculture specialists, they can create new ways to produce food.

### Medical Specialist

Skilled in healing and medicine. They can treat injuries, cure illnesses, and even experiment with medical enhancements. While lack of food and water have been the main harships that have decimated the human population, we have also been ravaged by resurgent and novel illnesses. Medical specialists are often the only ones to stand between us and the next pandemic.

### Nomadic Trader

Master negotiators and traders who thrive on bartering and building alliances. They often carry valuable resources and information. Without a central authority like a national government, wasteful conflict between rival factions threaten our survival. The nomadic trader is much more than just one who exchanges goods with other factions. They can prevent the next war from breaking out.

### Communications Specialist

Experts in diplomacy, negotiation, and information gathering. They excel at building alliances and unraveling mysteries. While nomadic traders specialize in communicating with rival factions, and often are the ones sent out by the communications teams to interact with these factions, communications specialists organize the local populace and bring social chaos into order.
